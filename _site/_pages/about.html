        Stride unites aspiring designers with companies seeking designers.
        Students will have the chance to share their work and experience with
        design-minded company representatives. Although having a portfolio isn’t
        a requirement, we strongly encourage students interested in attending to
        create one to demonstrate your design skills put into practice.
