      <h2 class="text-green">Made for Designers</h2>
      <p>The traditional career fair format isnâ€™t catered toward students seeking design roles. Designers need a medium to showcase their work and experience. At Stride, students have the opportunity to secure individual time with recruiters to present their projects and portfolios.</p>
