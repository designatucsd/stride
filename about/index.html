        <h2 class="mb-1">Centered around Designers</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Stride unites aspiring designers with companies seeking designers. 
          Students will have the chance to share their work and experience 
          with design-minded company representatives. Although having a 
          portfolio isn’t a requirement, we strongly encourage students 
          interested in attending to create one to demonstrate your design 
          skills put into practice.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mb-1">An Environment that Promotes Conversation</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">
          At Stride, we find that the scaled down setting allows for employers 
          and students to engage in longer, more fruitful conversations. 
          Instead of just handing off a resume, it’s common and highly 
          encouraged for 5–10 minute mini portfolio reviews to take place.

            While there is no dress code for Stride, we do recommend making 
            sure you look “presentable”. Your interpretation of "presentable" 
            is up to you--some people dress in business attire, while others 
            dress as they normally do. Maybe skip the shirt with a stain?
